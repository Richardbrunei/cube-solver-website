# Upside Down Rotation Fix

## Problem
When the cube was rotated upside down (X rotation > 90° or < -90°), the left-right drag rotation felt inverted and unintuitive. Dragging left would rotate the cube right, and vice versa.

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because the Y-axis rotation direction wasn't adjusted based on the cube's orientation. When the cube is upside down, the coordinate system is effectively flipped, so the same Y rotation value produces the opposite visual effect.

## Solution
Modified the rotation logic in `scripts/cube-renderer.js` to:

1. **Calculate Y direction at drag start** in `handleMouseDown` based on current orientation
2. **Store the Y direction** for the duration of the drag in `this.dragYDirection`
3. **Use stored direction** in `handleMouseMove` instead of recalculating each frame
4. **Prevent mid-drag direction flip** when crossing the 90° threshold

### Code Changes

**In `handleMouseDown`:**
```javascript
// Calculate Y direction at drag start based on current orientation
// Normalize X rotation to -180 to 180 range
let normalizedX = ((this.rotationX % 360) + 360) % 360;
if (normalizedX > 180) normalizedX -= 360;

// Determine if cube is upside down and set Y direction for this drag
const isUpsideDown = normalizedX > 90 || normalizedX < -90;
this.dragYDirection = isUpsideDown ? -1 : 1;
```

**In `handleMouseMove`:**
```javascript
// Update X rotation (vertical drag)
this.rotationX = this.dragStartRotationX - (deltaY * this.rotationSensitivity);

// Update Y rotation (horizontal drag) using the direction set at drag start
// This prevents the direction from flipping mid-drag when crossing the 90° threshold
this.rotationY = this.dragStartRotationY + (deltaX * this.rotationSensitivity * this.dragYDirection);
```

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. **tests/test-upside-down-rotation.html** - Dedicated test for upside-down rotation behavior
   - Provides preset rotation angles to test different orientations
   - Shows real-time orientation status and Y direction multiplier
   - Visual indicator for normal vs upside-down orientation

2. **tests/test-view-switching-rotation.html** - Updated with upside-down test case
   - Added "Rotate Upside Down" button
   - Added manual test checklist item for upside-down rotation

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open `tests/test-upside-down-rotation.html` in browser
2. Click through different rotation presets:
   - Normal View (0°, 0°)
   - Slight Tilt (45°, 0°)
   - Edge Case (90°, 0°)
   - Upside Down (150°, 0°)
   - Fully Inverted (180°, 0°)
3. For each preset, drag left/right and verify the rotation feels natural
4. Expected: Dragging left should always rotate the visible front face to the left

## Additional Improvement: Continuous Dragging

Also removed the `mouseleave` event handler that was stopping the drag when the mouse moved outside the cube element. Now dragging continues smoothly even when the mouse moves outside the cube, and only stops when the mouse button is released (`mouseup` event).

### Changes Made
1. Removed `boundMouseLeave` property and event handler
2. Removed `handleMouseLeave` method
3. Removed `mouseleave` event listener from cube element
4. Drag now only stops on `mouseup`, regardless of mouse position

## Impact
- ✅ Improved user experience with intuitive rotation controls
- ✅ Consistent drag behavior regardless of cube orientation
- ✅ Continuous dragging even when mouse moves outside cube
- ✅ More natural drag interaction (stops only on mouse release)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Maintains rotation state preservation during view switching
