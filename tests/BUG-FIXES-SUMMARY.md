# Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
Two critical bugs were discovered during Task 6 implementation and have been fixed.

## Bug 1: Reset Button Switches View ❌ → ✅

### Problem
When the user clicked the reset button while viewing the cube in net view, the application would automatically switch to 3D view. This was unexpected behavior - users expected the view to remain unchanged after reset.

### Root Cause
The `reset()` method in `CubeState` class was explicitly calling `this.setCurrentView('3d')`, which forced a view change regardless of the current view state.

**Location:** `scripts/cube-state.js` - `reset()` method

### Solution
Removed the `setCurrentView('3d')` call from the reset method. The reset now only:
1. Resets the cubestring to solved state
2. Resets edit mode to false
3. Preserves the current view (3D or net)

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE (line 732)
reset() {
    this.cubestring = this.SOLVED_CUBESTRING;
    this.setCurrentView('3d');  // ❌ This forced view change
    this.setEditMode(false);
    this.notifyChange('reset', { ... });
}

// AFTER
reset() {
    this.cubestring = this.SOLVED_CUBESTRING;
    this.setEditMode(false);  // ✅ View is now preserved
    this.notifyChange('reset', { ... });
}
```

### Impact
- ✅ Users can now reset the cube while staying in their preferred view
- ✅ Better user experience - no unexpected view changes
- ✅ Consistent behavior across both views

---

## Bug 2: Only Blue and Red Faces Render ❌ → ✅

### Problem
When rendering the cube (both 3D and net views), only the blue (back) and red (right) faces were displaying correctly. The other four faces (top, front, bottom, left) appeared blank or with incorrect colors.

### Root Cause
**Notation Mismatch:** The application uses two different color notation systems:

1. **Display Notation** (used by renderer): `W`, `Y`, `R`, `O`, `B`, `G`
   - W = White, Y = Yellow, R = Red, O = Orange, B = Blue, G = Green

2. **Cubestring Notation** (used by backend): `U`, `R`, `F`, `D`, `L`, `B`
   - U = Up (White), R = Right (Red), F = Front (Green), D = Down (Yellow), L = Left (Orange), B = Back (Blue)

The `COLORS` object only contained display notation keys. When the renderer tried to look up colors for cubestring characters like `U`, `F`, `D`, or `L`, they weren't found, resulting in undefined colors.

**Why R and B worked:** These characters exist in both notations:
- `R` = Red in both systems
- `B` = Blue in both systems

**Location:** `scripts/cube-state.js` - `COLORS` object initialization

### Solution
Extended the `COLORS` object to include both notation systems. Added cubestring notation keys that map to the same hex color values as their display notation equivalents.

### Code Changes
```javascript
// BEFORE (lines 8-16)
this.COLORS = {
    W: '#FFFFFF', // White
    Y: '#FFFF00', // Yellow
    R: '#FF0000', // Red
    O: '#FFA500', // Orange
    B: '#0000FF', // Blue
    G: '#00FF00'  // Green
};

// AFTER
this.COLORS = {
    W: '#FFFFFF', // White
    Y: '#FFFF00', // Yellow
    R: '#FF0000', // Red
    O: '#FFA500', // Orange
    B: '#0000FF', // Blue
    G: '#00FF00', // Green
    // Cubestring notation (backend format)
    U: '#FFFFFF', // Up face - White
    D: '#FFFF00', // Down face - Yellow
    F: '#00FF00', // Front face - Green
    L: '#FFA500', // Left face - Orange
    // R already defined above as Red
    // B already defined above as Blue
};
```

### Color Mapping Table
| Cubestring | Display | Color Name | Hex Value |
|------------|---------|------------|-----------|
| U | W | White | #FFFFFF |
| D | Y | Yellow | #FFFF00 |
| R | R | Red | #FF0000 |
| L | O | Orange | #FFA500 |
| F | G | Green | #00FF00 |
| B | B | Blue | #0000FF |

### Impact
- ✅ All 6 faces now render correctly in both 3D and net views
- ✅ Proper color display for all stickers
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (both notations work)
- ✅ No changes needed to renderer code

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. **`tests/test-bug-fixes.html`** - Comprehensive automated tests for both bugs
2. **Updated `tests/TASK6-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** - Documentation of fixes

### Test Coverage

#### Bug 1 Tests (View Preservation)
- ✅ Reset preserves net view
- ✅ Reset preserves 3D view
- ✅ Renderer stays in net view after reset
- ✅ No unexpected view changes

#### Bug 2 Tests (Color Mapping)
- ✅ COLORS object includes all cubestring characters (U,R,F,D,L,B)
- ✅ All cubestring characters are valid colors
- ✅ All 6 faces render in 3D view
- ✅ All 6 faces render in net view
- ✅ Each face has 9 stickers
- ✅ Stickers have correct colors from cubestring
- ✅ Each face type has correct center color
- ✅ All face types are present (top, right, front, bottom, left, back)

### How to Run Tests
1. Start a local web server in the project root
2. Open `tests/test-bug-fixes.html` in a browser

## Verification Steps

### Manual Testing
1. ✅ Open the application in a browser
2. ✅ Switch to net view
3. ✅ Click reset button
4. ✅ Verify view stays in net view (not switching to 3D)
5. ✅ Verify all 6 faces are visible and colored correctly
6. ✅ Switch to 3D view
7. ✅ Verify all 6 faces are visible and colored correctly
8. ✅ Click reset button
9. ✅ Verify view stays in 3D view

### Automated Testing
1. ✅ Run `tests/test-bug-fixes.html`
2. ✅ All 12 tests pass
3. ✅ Visual inspection shows all faces rendering

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Notation Consistency
When working with multiple notation systems (display vs backend), ensure all systems are properly mapped in shared data structures like the `COLORS` object.

### 2. View State Management
State reset operations should be careful about what they reset. User preferences like view mode should typically be preserved unless explicitly requested to change.

### 3. Testing Importance
These bugs were discovered during implementation testing. Comprehensive test coverage helps catch issues early.

### 4. Backward Compatibility
By adding cubestring notation to the existing `COLORS` object rather than replacing it, we maintained backward compatibility with any code using display notation.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

Both bugs have been fixed, tested, and documented. The application now:
- Preserves view mode when resetting the cube
- Correctly renders all 6 faces with proper colors in both 3D and net views
- Supports both display notation and cubestring notation for colors
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
