# String View Reset Button Integration

## Summary
Integrated the reset button functionality with the string view so that when users click the reset button while in string view, the display automatically updates to show the solved cubestring.

## Bug Fix
Fixed issue where clicking reset button in string view would switch to net view instead of staying in string view.

## Changes Made

### scripts/string-view.js

1. **Added Change Listener Setup**
   - Added `changeListenerId` property to track the listener
   - Created `setupChangeListener()` method to listen for cube state changes
   - Listens for 'reset' and 'cubeStringChanged' events
   - Automatically calls `update()` when these events occur

2. **Enhanced Update Method**
   - Updates display, input, and character count
   - Clears validation messages when updated externally
   - Respects `isEditing` flag to prevent overwriting user input

3. **Added Editing State Tracking**
   - Tracks when user is actively editing the textarea
   - Sets `isEditing = true` on focus
   - Sets `isEditing = false` on blur (with delay for button clicks)
   - Prevents external updates from overwriting user's work

4. **Added Destroy Method**
   - Properly removes change listener when string view is destroyed
   - Cleans up resources to prevent memory leaks

### scripts/cube-renderer.js

1. **Fixed handleStateChange Method**
   - Added string view case to 'reset' and 'stateRestored' events
   - Added string view case to 'viewChanged' event
   - Prevents automatic switch to net view when resetting in string view
   - Now properly re-renders the current view regardless of which one is active

2. **Enhanced Destroy Method**
   - Added cleanup for string view instance
   - Calls `stringView.destroy()` if it exists
   - Sets `stringView = null` to free memory

## How It Works

1. **User clicks reset button** → ResetButton calls `cubeState.reset()`
2. **CubeState fires 'reset' event** → All change listeners are notified
3. **StringView receives event** → Checks if user is editing
4. **If not editing** → Updates display, input, and clears validation
5. **If editing** → Waits until user finishes (blur event)

## User Experience

### Before Reset
- User sees scrambled cubestring in string view
- Display shows: `RFDLBUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB`
- Input field contains the same scrambled string

### After Reset
- User clicks reset button (with confirmation if not solved)
- String view automatically updates
- Display shows: `UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB`
- Input field updates to solved state
- Character count shows 54/54
- Validation message is cleared

### While Editing
- If user is typing in the input field
- External updates are blocked until they finish
- Prevents frustrating interruptions to user's work

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Open the main application
2. Switch to String View
3. Click "Reset Cube" button
4. Verify string view updates to solved state

### Automated Test
Open `tests/test-string-view-reset.html`:
1. Click "Scramble Cube" to randomize
2. Observe string view updates
3. Click "Reset Cube"
4. Verify string view shows solved state

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - All views (3D, Net, String) respond to reset button
2. **User-Friendly** - No need to manually refresh or switch views
3. **Smart Updates** - Respects user's editing state
4. **Clean Code** - Proper listener management and cleanup
5. **Memory Safe** - No memory leaks from orphaned listeners
