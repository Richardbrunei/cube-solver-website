# Environment Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env for local development (optional)

# Backend Path (optional)
# Leave empty to use the default local path or built-in fallbacks
# Set this in Render environment variables if you have a custom backend location
# BACKEND_PATH=/path/to/your/backend

# Port (automatically set by Render, but you can override for local testing)
# PORT=5000

# Flask Environment
# FLASK_ENV=production

# Notes:
# - Local development automatically uses: C:\Users\Liang\OneDrive\Documents\cube_code_backend
# - Render deployment uses built-in fallbacks (no external backend needed)
# - Camera features require local hardware and won't work on Render
