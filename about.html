                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>
                    Rubik's Cube Solver is a complete digital companion for your physical cube. 
                    Whether you're a speedcuber analyzing patterns, a beginner learning to solve, or just someone 
                    who loves the iconic puzzle, this tool lets you capture, visualize, solve, and learn from 
                    your cube states with ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built with vanilla JavaScript and powered by Python computer vision and the Kociemba solving algorithm, 
                    it combines the simplicity of web technologies with advanced color detection and optimal solving 
                    to bring your cube to life on screen.

                <h2>Technology</h2>
                <p>
                    This project showcases modern web development without the complexity of build tools or frameworks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules), CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, 3D transforms), HTML5 Web APIs</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python 3.7+ with Flask, OpenCV for computer vision, NumPy for color processing, Kociemba for optimal solving</li>
                    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Modular ES6 design with centralized state management, observer pattern, and event-driven communication</li>
                    <li><strong>No Build Process:</strong> Direct browser execution, keeping things simple and fast</li>
                    <li><strong>Production Ready:</strong> Deployable to Render with comprehensive deployment documentation</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>The Cube State Format</h2>
                <p>
                    Under the hood, cube states are represented as a 54-character "cubestring" following standard notation:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This represents the six faces in order: Up (White), Right (Red), Front (Green), Down (Yellow), 
                    Left (Orange), Back (Blue). Each face has 9 stickers, reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Deployment</h2>
                <p>
                    This app is production-ready and can be deployed to platforms like Render in minutes. 
                    The single-service architecture serves both frontend and backend from one Flask app, 
                    making deployment simple and cost-effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> Camera features require local hardware and won't work on cloud deployments. 
                    All other features (visualization, manual editing, solving, animation) work perfectly in production.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-section">
                <h2>Open Source</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is built with passion for the Rubik's cube community. The modular architecture 
                    makes it easy to understand, extend, and customize. Whether you want to add new features, 
                    integrate different solving algorithms, or use it as a learning resource, the clean codebase 
                    and comprehensive documentation make it accessible to developers of all levels.
