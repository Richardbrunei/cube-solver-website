                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>
                    Rubik's Cube Interactive bridges the gap between your physical cube and the digital world. 
                    Whether you're a speedcuber analyzing patterns, a beginner learning algorithms, or just someone 
                    who loves the iconic puzzle, this tool lets you capture, visualize, and manipulate cube states 
                    with ease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Built with vanilla JavaScript and powered by Python computer vision, it combines the simplicity 
                    of web technologies with the accuracy of HSV-based color detection to bring your cube to life on screen.

                <p>
                    This project showcases modern web development without the complexity of build tools or frameworks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules), CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, 3D transforms), HTML5 Web APIs</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Python 3.7+ with Flask, OpenCV for computer vision, NumPy for color processing</li>
                    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Modular ES6 design with centralized state management and observer pattern</li>
                    <li><strong>No Build Process:</strong> Direct browser execution, keeping things simple and fast</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Cube State Format</h2>
                <p>
                    Under the hood, cube states are represented as a 54-character "cubestring" following standard notation:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This represents the six faces in order: Up (White), Right (Red), Front (Green), Down (Yellow), 
                    Left (Orange), Back (Blue). Each face has 9 stickers, reading left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    This project is built with passion for the Rubik's cube community. Feel free to explore the code, 
                    learn from it, and build upon it. The modular architecture makes it easy to extend with new features 
                    like solving algorithms, move notation, or scramble generators.
