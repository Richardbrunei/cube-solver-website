# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a simple, interactive home page for a Rubik's cube application. The home page should provide users with a clean interface featuring a title, navigation to an about page, and an interactive cube visualization in the center. Users should be able to switch between different cube views (3D model and net), capture cube states using their camera, and edit cube colors directly on the interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple header with a title and navigation, so that I can understand what the page is about and access additional information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the home page THEN the system SHALL display a clear title at the top of the page
2. WHEN a user views the header THEN the system SHALL provide a link to navigate to an about page
3. WHEN a user clicks the about link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the about page

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see an interactive cube visualization in the center of the page, so that I can engage with the cube representation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the home page THEN the system SHALL display a cube visualization prominently in the center
2. WHEN a user interacts with the cube THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and responsiveness
3. WHEN the cube is displayed THEN the system SHALL render it with clear, distinguishable colors for each face

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between different cube views, so that I can see the cube in different formats that suit my preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the cube visualization THEN the system SHALL provide options to switch between 3D model and net views
2. WHEN a user selects the 3D model view THEN the system SHALL display the cube as a three-dimensional interactive model
3. WHEN a user selects the net view THEN the system SHALL display the cube as a flattened net layout showing all faces
4. WHEN a user switches between views THEN the system SHALL maintain the current color state of the cube

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use my camera to capture the cube state, so that I can quickly input my physical cube's configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to input cube colors THEN the system SHALL provide a camera button option
2. WHEN a user clicks the camera button THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions and open camera interface
3. WHEN a user captures images with the camera THEN the system SHALL process the images to detect cube colors
4. WHEN camera detection is complete THEN the system SHALL update the cube visualization with the detected colors
5. IF camera access is denied or unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually edit the colors on the cube, so that I can customize or correct the cube state as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the cube visualization THEN the system SHALL provide a way to edit individual cube face colors
2. WHEN a user selects a cube face or sticker THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected element
3. WHEN a user chooses a new color THEN the system SHALL update the selected face/sticker with the new color immediately
4. WHEN a user edits colors THEN the system SHALL provide a color palette with standard Rubik's cube colors
5. WHEN a user makes color changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the changes across view switches

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset the cube to its solved state, so that I can start fresh or return to a known configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the cube interface THEN the system SHALL provide a clearly visible reset button
2. WHEN a user clicks the reset button THEN the system SHALL return the cube to its solved state (all faces showing their respective solid colors)
3. WHEN the cube is reset THEN the system SHALL maintain the current view (3D or net) and update the visualization immediately
4. WHEN the reset is complete THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback to confirm the action was successful

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to validate and fix my cube configuration after capturing images, so that I can ensure the cube state is accurate and solvable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has captured images using the camera THEN the system SHALL display a "Validate Cube" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Validate Cube" button THEN the system SHALL call the appropriate backend validation functions
3. WHEN the validation process runs THEN the system SHALL check if the current cube state represents a valid, solvable Rubik's cube
4. IF the cube state is invalid THEN the system SHALL attempt to automatically fix common errors (duplicate colors, impossible configurations)
5. WHEN validation and fixing is complete THEN the system SHALL update the cube visualization with the corrected state
6. WHEN validation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to the user about whether the cube was valid or what corrections were made
7. IF the cube cannot be automatically fixed THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages indicating what needs manual correction

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the page to be responsive and perform well, so that I can use it effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the page on different devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
2. WHEN a user interacts with cube controls THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms for smooth interaction
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the initial cube visualization within 2 seconds
