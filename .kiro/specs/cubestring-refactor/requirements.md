# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the Rubik's cube application to use a single cubestring variable as the source of truth for cube state. The cubestring will use standard cube notation (u, l, t, d, f, b representing up, left, top, down, front, back faces) and will be the single source from which both the net view and 3D representation are derived. This simplification will make the state management more straightforward, reduce complexity, and ensure consistency between different views and editing modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single cubestring variable to represent the entire cube state, so that state management is simplified and consistent across all views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL create a cubestring variable representing the default solved cube state
2. WHEN the cubestring is defined THEN the system SHALL use the format with faces represented as u, l, t, d, f, b (up, left, top, down, front, back)
3. WHEN the cubestring is stored THEN the system SHALL contain exactly 54 characters representing all stickers on the cube (9 stickers per face Ã— 6 faces)
4. WHEN the cubestring is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide a clear mapping between string positions and physical cube locations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the 3D cube visualization to be generated from the cubestring, so that the 3D view always reflects the current cube state accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the 3D view is rendered THEN the system SHALL read colors from the cubestring variable
2. WHEN the cubestring changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the 3D visualization to reflect the new state
3. WHEN rendering the 3D view THEN the system SHALL correctly map each character in the cubestring to its corresponding sticker position in 3D space
4. WHEN the 3D view updates THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth transitions and visual feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the net view to be generated from the cubestring, so that the net view always reflects the current cube state accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the net view is rendered THEN the system SHALL read colors from the cubestring variable
2. WHEN the cubestring changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the net visualization to reflect the new state
3. WHEN rendering the net view THEN the system SHALL correctly map each character in the cubestring to its corresponding sticker position in the net layout
4. WHEN the net view updates THEN the system SHALL maintain visual consistency with the 3D view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want camera capture to update the cubestring, so that my physical cube configuration is accurately represented in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN camera capture detects cube colors THEN the system SHALL update the cubestring with the detected color values
2. WHEN the cubestring is updated from camera input THEN the system SHALL trigger updates to both 3D and net views automatically
3. WHEN camera processing is complete THEN the system SHALL validate that the cubestring contains valid cube notation
4. IF camera detection produces invalid data THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and maintain the previous valid cubestring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want color editing to modify the cubestring, so that manual edits are reflected consistently across all views.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user edits a sticker color THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding position in the cubestring
2. WHEN the cubestring is modified through color editing THEN the system SHALL trigger updates to both 3D and net views automatically
3. WHEN a color edit is applied THEN the system SHALL validate that the new cubestring maintains valid cube notation
4. WHEN editing in either 3D or net view THEN the system SHALL update the same underlying cubestring

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the reset function to restore the cubestring to its default solved state, so that I can start fresh with a known configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the reset button THEN the system SHALL set the cubestring to the default solved state
2. WHEN the cubestring is reset THEN the system SHALL trigger updates to both 3D and net views automatically
3. WHEN reset is complete THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the action
4. WHEN the cube is reset THEN the system SHALL maintain the current view mode (3D or net)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cubestring format to be well-documented and consistent, so that it can be easily understood and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cubestring format is defined THEN the system SHALL document the exact order of faces and stickers
2. WHEN the cubestring is used THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent notation where each character represents a specific face color
3. WHEN the cubestring is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide helper functions to convert between string positions and face/sticker coordinates
4. WHEN the cubestring format is implemented THEN the system SHALL include clear comments explaining the mapping

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactoring to maintain backward compatibility with existing features, so that no functionality is lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing features (camera, color editing, view switching, reset)
2. WHEN the cubestring implementation is active THEN the system SHALL perform at least as well as the previous implementation
3. WHEN users interact with the application THEN the system SHALL provide the same user experience as before the refactoring
4. WHEN the refactoring is tested THEN the system SHALL pass all existing test cases
