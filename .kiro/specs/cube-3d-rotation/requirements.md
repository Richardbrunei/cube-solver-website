# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to interactively rotate the 3D Rubik's cube visualization using mouse drag interactions. Users will be able to freely rotate the cube in any direction to view all faces from different angles, enhancing the visualization experience and making it easier to inspect the cube state from multiple perspectives.

## Glossary

- **Cube Renderer**: The JavaScript module responsible for rendering the 3D visualization of the Rubik's cube
- **Rotation State**: The current X and Y rotation angles of the 3D cube element
- **Drag Interaction**: Mouse-based interaction where the user clicks and drags to rotate the cube
- **Transform Matrix**: CSS 3D transform property that controls the cube's rotation in 3D space
- **Rotation Sensitivity**: The multiplier that determines how much the cube rotates relative to mouse movement distance

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to rotate the 3D cube by clicking and dragging with my mouse, so that I can view the cube from any angle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the mouse button down on the 3D cube, THE Cube Renderer SHALL initiate drag tracking
2. WHILE the user moves the mouse with the button pressed, THE Cube Renderer SHALL update the cube rotation based on mouse movement delta
3. WHEN the user releases the mouse button, THE Cube Renderer SHALL stop drag tracking and maintain the current rotation
4. THE Cube Renderer SHALL apply rotation transformations smoothly without visual stuttering
5. WHERE the user drags horizontally, THE Cube Renderer SHALL rotate the cube around the Y-axis
6. WHERE the user drags vertically, THE Cube Renderer SHALL rotate the cube around the X-axis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cube rotation to feel natural and responsive, so that I have precise control over the viewing angle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cube Renderer SHALL apply a rotation sensitivity factor between 0.3 and 0.5 degrees per pixel of mouse movement
2. THE Cube Renderer SHALL preserve the cube's current rotation when starting a new drag interaction
3. THE Cube Renderer SHALL prevent the default browser drag behavior during cube rotation
4. WHEN the user performs rapid mouse movements, THE Cube Renderer SHALL maintain smooth rotation without lag
5. THE Cube Renderer SHALL update rotation at a minimum rate of 30 frames per second during drag operations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the cube to maintain its rotation state when I switch between views or interact with stickers, so that my preferred viewing angle is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches from 3D view to net view and back, THE Cube Renderer SHALL restore the previous rotation state
2. WHILE the user clicks on individual stickers, THE Cube Renderer SHALL maintain the current rotation angle
3. THE Cube Renderer SHALL store rotation state as X and Y angle values in degrees
4. WHEN the cube is reset to solved state, THE Cube Renderer SHALL preserve the current rotation angle
5. THE Cube Renderer SHALL apply the stored rotation state when re-rendering the 3D view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback during rotation interactions, so that I understand the cube is responding to my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over the 3D cube, THE Cube Renderer SHALL change the cursor to indicate the cube is draggable
2. WHILE the user is actively dragging the cube, THE Cube Renderer SHALL change the cursor to a grabbing hand icon
3. WHEN the user starts dragging, THE Cube Renderer SHALL disable the hover scale effect
4. WHEN the user stops dragging, THE Cube Renderer SHALL re-enable the hover scale effect
5. THE Cube Renderer SHALL maintain sticker interactivity during and after rotation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reset button to restore the cube rotation to the default viewing angle, so that I can quickly return to a standard perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cube Renderer SHALL display a small reset rotation button when in 3D view
2. THE Cube Renderer SHALL position the reset button near the cube container without obscuring the cube
3. WHEN the user clicks the reset rotation button, THE Cube Renderer SHALL animate the cube back to default rotation angles over 0.5 seconds
4. THE Cube Renderer SHALL define default rotation as -15 degrees on X-axis and 25 degrees on Y-axis
5. THE Cube Renderer SHALL show the reset button only when the current rotation differs from default rotation by more than 5 degrees on either axis
6. THE Cube Renderer SHALL style the reset button with an icon indicating rotation reset functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the rotation reset button to be visually distinct from the cube state reset button, so that I don't confuse the two different reset functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cube Renderer SHALL position the rotation reset button within or adjacent to the cube container area
2. THE Cube Renderer SHALL style the rotation reset button with a rotation-specific icon (such as a circular arrow or compass icon)
3. THE Cube Renderer SHALL use different visual styling for the rotation reset button compared to the cube state reset button
4. THE Cube Renderer SHALL position the rotation reset button separately from the main control buttons area
5. THE Cube Renderer SHALL include a tooltip or label indicating "Reset View" or "Reset Rotation" on hover

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the rotation functionality to be encapsulated within the CubeRenderer class, so that it maintains clean separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cube Renderer SHALL manage all rotation state internally within the class
2. THE Cube Renderer SHALL expose public methods for rotation control (reset, set angles)
3. THE Cube Renderer SHALL emit custom events when rotation state changes
4. THE Cube Renderer SHALL clean up all rotation event listeners when destroyed
5. THE Cube Renderer SHALL not modify global state or other components during rotation operations
