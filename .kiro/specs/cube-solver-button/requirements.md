# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a solve button to the Rubik's Cube Interactive application that generates step-by-step solving instructions using the Kociemba algorithm. The button will be prominently displayed at the bottom of the interface and will validate the cube state before attempting to solve it. The solution will be presented in standard Rubik's cube notation (R, L, U, D, F, B with modifiers) that users can follow to solve their physical cube.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Rubik's Cube Interactive web application
- **Kociemba Algorithm**: A two-phase algorithm for solving Rubik's cubes that finds near-optimal solutions (typically 20 moves or less)
- **Cubestring**: A 54-character string representing the cube state in the format UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBBBB
- **Cube Notation**: Standard notation for cube moves (R=Right, L=Left, U=Up, D=Down, F=Front, B=Back, with ' for counter-clockwise and 2 for 180-degree turns)
- **Backend API**: The Flask-based Python API that processes cube operations
- **Frontend**: The browser-based JavaScript application that displays the cube interface
- **Solve Button**: A UI button that triggers the solving algorithm
- **Solution Modal**: A dialog box that displays the solving instructions to the user

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cube enthusiast, I want to click a solve button to get step-by-step instructions for solving my cube, so that I can learn how to solve it or verify my current state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the solve button, THE System SHALL validate the current cube state before attempting to solve
2. IF the cube state is invalid, THEN THE System SHALL display an error message explaining why the cube cannot be solved
3. WHEN the cube state is valid, THE System SHALL send the cubestring to the backend API for solving
4. WHEN the backend receives a solve request, THE System SHALL invoke the Kociemba algorithm with the provided cubestring
5. WHEN the Kociemba algorithm completes, THE System SHALL return the solution as a sequence of moves in standard cube notation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the solve button to be prominently displayed and easily accessible, so that I can quickly access the solving functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL display a solve button at the bottom of the controls section
2. THE System SHALL style the solve button to be visually distinct and prominent (larger size or different color)
3. THE System SHALL display an appropriate icon on the solve button (such as a lightbulb or puzzle piece emoji)
4. WHILE the solve operation is in progress, THE System SHALL disable the solve button and show a loading indicator
5. WHEN the solve operation completes or fails, THE System SHALL re-enable the solve button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the solving instructions in a clear, readable format, so that I can easily follow the steps to solve my physical cube.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a solution is generated, THE System SHALL display the solution in a modal dialog
2. THE System SHALL format the solution moves with proper spacing and grouping for readability
3. THE System SHALL display the total number of moves in the solution
4. THE System SHALL provide a close button to dismiss the solution modal
5. THE System SHALL allow the user to copy the solution to their clipboard

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want helpful error messages when the cube cannot be solved, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the cube state has incorrect color counts, THEN THE System SHALL display an error message indicating which colors are incorrect
2. IF the cube state is physically impossible, THEN THE System SHALL display an error message explaining the cube configuration is invalid
3. IF the Kociemba algorithm fails, THEN THE System SHALL display a user-friendly error message with troubleshooting suggestions
4. IF the backend API is unavailable, THEN THE System SHALL display an error message indicating the backend is not responding
5. THE System SHALL log detailed error information to the browser console for debugging purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the solve functionality to integrate cleanly with the existing architecture, so that it maintains code quality and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL create a new backend API endpoint at /api/solve-cube for handling solve requests
2. THE System SHALL create a new frontend module solve-button.js following the existing ES6 module pattern
3. THE System SHALL use the existing CubeState class to retrieve the current cubestring
4. THE System SHALL follow the existing error handling patterns used in validation-button.js
5. THE System SHALL reuse the existing modal styling patterns for displaying the solution
